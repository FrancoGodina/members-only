## About
This web app hosts an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is. You can also become an admin and delete messages. The page renders different views based on what kind of user you are(normal user, member, admin). Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt.

## Technologies
* Back-End: Node.js/Express
* Database: MongoDB
* Front-End: Bootstrap 5, Pug.

## What I learned
This project was an opportunity to work on my authentication skills using Express. I learned Passport.js which I used to implement a secure form of user authentication. I also learned bcrypt which I used to encrypt passwords.
